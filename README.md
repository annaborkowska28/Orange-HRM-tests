# QA Portfolio â€“ Manual Testing Projects (OrangeHRM)

## Welcome  
This repository is where I explore the world of manual testing â€” trying out real tools,
following real workflows, and learning a ton along the way (including how to stay calm when things break ðŸ˜®)

I use Jira + Xray to manage my test cases and track executions (still learning how to deal with Jira - weâ€™re in a love-hate relationship)
